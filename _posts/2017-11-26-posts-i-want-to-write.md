I'm using my inaugural post as a convenient index of topics I'd like to write about.  Listed in no particular order, these are:

 * A Comparison of [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) With Similar Technologies Such as [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/Main_Page), [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/), [Intel Clear Containers](https://clearlinux.org/features/intel%C2%AE-clear-containers) and [LightVM](http://cnp.neclab.eu/projects/lightvm/).
 * A More Generalized Exploration of Modern Tooling in Scientific Computing
 * The Role of the Scientist Historically vs. the Modern Role of the Scientist with an emphasis on the idiosyncrasies in scientific professional culture that persist for legacy reasons.
 * Creating Minimalistic Linux Distributions for Emulating Older Architectures
 * A Philosophical Treatment of Scientific Reproducibility with a particular focus on [convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine#Convergence) (as per CFEngine / math).
 * Using Infrastructure as Code ([Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) and [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org/) for Reproducible Workflows
 * How to Translate the Culture and Tooling of Electronic Musicians (via flow-based programming tools like [Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software) / [Pd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data))) to the Scientific and Library Fields
