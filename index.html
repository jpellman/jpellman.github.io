		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Greetings!  My name is John Pellman.  I am an aspiring system administrator / cognitive science geek who is currently working as a neuroscience research aide at the Child Mind Institute in Manhattan. My interests lie at the intersection of science and IT, with a particular focus on how technology can facilitate progress in our understanding of the world and improve the human race's quality of life.<br><br>In our contemporary, post-industrial age a pervasive fear has arisen that, with increased automation, technology will replace the need for humanity. I believe that technology cannot replace humanity, and that this perspective that humans can be replaced should be discarded for a healthier view in which society perceives technology as a tool to accompany cognition rather than a stand-in for expertise and wisdom. Technology (as a tool) should be used to enable and ennoble humanity, augmenting our natural abilities just as previous tools such as hammers, quills, glasses, and printing presses have augmented us in the past.  In my role as a technical professional, I would like to serve to help society leverage technology to make the world a better place.  In brief, I like to bring a humanistic perspective to my work.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<div>
			<p>I'm using this website as an opportunity to practice systems administration.  It is hosted on a virtual private server that I maintain remotely from my stronghold in upstate New York.  The domain name is a portmanteau of my high school nickname (J-Pell) and <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">a popular C library used to encode/decode JPEG images</a>.  Since this website / server is a bit of an experiment, expect to see it change with some regularity as I try out new things.</p>

		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Many of my projects are on my <a href="http://www.github.com/jaipel">Github</a>.  Here's an overview of some of them:<br><br>

			<a href="https://github.com/jaipel/textgridR">textgridR</a> - textgridR is an R package that allows you to load in <a href="http://www.praat.org/">Praat</a> TextGrid files and manipulate them as R objects.  <a href="http://www.praat.org/">Praat</a> is an application used by linguists to perform phonetic analysis and annotate speech.<br><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/jaipel/spmR">spmR</a> - spmR is an implementation of <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">SPM</a>, a popular neuroimaging technique (which has previously been implemented as a MATLAB toolbox by the Wellcome Trust) in R.  The scope of this project is quite broad, and likely cannot be fulfilled by one individual alone. Nevertheless, I plan to at least make some simple improvements to some code written by others as well as contribute an improved function for loading an fMRI model specification into R.<br><br>
			<a href="http://libjpel.so/">libjpel.so</a> - I'm using this website as a sandbox to improve my system administration skills.  Specifically I am focusing on the popular and ubiquitous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP stack</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Previous Projects</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			<a href="http://libjpel.so/wod.html">WOD</a> - Throughout high school, I was tasked by my English teacher with administering a website containing all of the "words of the day" for a given month.  These words were used for weekly vocabulary quizzes and needed to be publicly available on the internet for students who had missed class.  Some of the example sentences could be rather humorous.
