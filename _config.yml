  Greetings! My name is John Pellman. I am a Linux systems administrator  who is presently based in New York City (though I grew up in the chilly hinterlands of upstate New York). My interests lie at the intersection of science and computing, with a particular focus on how technology can facilitate progress in our understanding of the world and improve the human raceâ€™s quality of life.
