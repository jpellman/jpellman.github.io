<sup>1</sup> Tabasco sauce is better.
<br>
<sup>2</sup> Could be used to describe my preoccupation with bad puns.
<br>
<sup>3</sup> French students should recognize this word.  It comes from the French "nouvel(m.)," which means "new."  Funny how much the meaning has changed over the centuries.
<br>
<sup>4</sup> Hmmm... I wonder how I'm going to remember this word.
<br>
<sup>5</sup> From the French word "travail" (big spelling change, eh?), which means "work".
<br>
<sup>6</sup> Replace "touring company" with "acting troupe" and this definition is a no-brainer.
<br>
<sup>7</sup> Edit out pretension. Replace "domicile" with "home".
<br>
<sup>8</sup> <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Post-eradication>False.</a>  Smallpox still does exist, albeit contained.
<br>
<sup>9</sup> From the Latin word for "wordy".  Further derived from the Latin word for "word," "verb".  Oh how the meaning has changed.
<br>
<sup>10</sup> See <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlecchino>Arlecchino</a>.
</a>
<br>
<sup>11</sup> Derived from the same root as the word "rumen," the first stomach in a cow.
<br>
<sup>12</sup> There were no verbs this month.  Anyone who noticed that is an instant winner. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PDuqk_DSMw">Click here to collect your prize.</a>
