In a past life, I worked on psycholinguistic research as a member of the [Language, Action and Brain Lab](http://www.lab-lab.org/).  This experience inspired me to write textgridR, an R package that allows you to load in Praat TextGrid files and manipulate them as R objects. [Praat](http://www.praat.org/) is an application used by linguists to perform phonetic analysis and annotate speech.

As an individual "recovering" from the research world, I enjoy continuing to contribute to the scientific computing community whenever possible.  I accomplish this by trying to stay involved in open science and citizen science initiatives.  One example of this would be running distributed computing projects on the [BOINC platform](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) or [Folding@home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  The badges below indicate which projects I run and how many credits Iâ€™ve accrued.

Furthermore, when learning new technologies (or reviewing old ones), I strive to create example code/configurations that could feasibly re-used by the scientific community.   [A recent attempt](https://github.com/jpellman/SunGridVagrantfiles) at creating Vagrantfiles that set up a Sun Grid Engine cluster for various platforms is emblematic of this variety of project.
